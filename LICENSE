 Permission is granted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                          PREAMBLE

The Common Sense License (CSL) is a pro-community, pro-worker
license designed to prevent the extraction of free labor from
open-source communities by large corporations, platform monopolies,
and entities with disproportionate economic power.

CSL protects:

  * Free use for individuals, nonprofits, cooperatives, researchers,
    academics, public-interest developers, and small businesses;
  * Mandatory reciprocity for large-scale commercial users who derive
    significant economic value from the Software;
  * Community autonomy through transparent governance, enforceable
    audit rights, and anti-evasion rules;
  * Rights of workers, contributors, and maintainers through
    ethical-use restrictions and labor-credit recognition.

If you profit significantly from the commons, you must contribute
proportionally back to the commons.

The precise terms and conditions follow.

    enforceable disclaimer and limitation under applicable law.

3.  CONVEYING VERBATIM COPIES

You may convey verbatim copies of the Software as you receive it,
provided you retain all copyright notices and include this License
with every copy.

4.	CONVEYING MODIFIED VERSIONS

    •	Include the date(s) of all modifications.
    •	Provide a description of the modifications sufficient to identify 
      functional changes from the original Software.

      any recipient of the modified version.
    •	For modifications deployed in production, hosted, or otherwise accessed by 
      end users (directly or indirectly), the modified source must be accessible 
      publicly or via an approved Commons Fund repository, unless a verified 
      Community Contribution equivalent to 13.37% of attributable revenue has 
      been made and documented.

  c) Retention of Notices
    •	Retain all original copyright, attribution, and license notices.
    •	Add your own copyright/attribution notice for your contributions.

  d) No Workarounds
    •	You may not evade these obligations through license splitting,

      without compliance.

5.	SOURCE CODE AVAILABILITY

  a) Requirement to Provide Source
    •	Any conveyed, publicly deployed, or commercially used version of the 
      Software must be accompanied by the corresponding complete source code.

      must provide documented Community Contributions equivalent to 13.37% of 
      attributable revenue, approved by the maintainers or Commons Fund.

  c) Compliance Enforcement
    •	Failure to provide source code, or failure to make adequate contributions 
      if keeping code private, constitutes a license violation and triggers 
      Section 11 (Termination).

6.  NO SUBLICENSING

You may not sublicense the Software under different terms.
All copies, modified or unmodified, must remain under this License.

7.	OBLIGATIONS OF LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL USERS

        Revenue are made; AND
      •	Contributions are documented and approved by maintainers or the Commons Fund.

      as a single entity when determining Large-Scale status or contribution 
      obligations.

  e) Audit Rights
    •	Maintainers or the Commons Fund may request independent third-party audits to 
      verify compliance with contributions, source disclosure, and obligations under 
      this License.
    •	Failure to comply with audit requests constitutes a license violation and 
      triggers Section 11 (Termination).

8.	REPORTING AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS

        i. A comprehensive description of all commercial uses of the Software;

      independent third-party audit to verify accuracy of reports, revenue 
      calculations, and compliance with contribution obligations.
    •	Large-Scale Commercial Users must cooperate fully with auditors, provide 
      access to relevant financial records, employee records, deployment logs, or 
      any other information reasonably necessary for verification.
    •	Audit costs will be borne by the audited party if discrepancies exceeding 5% of 
      reported Attributable Revenue or Contributions are found; otherwise, costs may be 
      borne by the requesting party.

  c) Record Retention
    •	Large-Scale Commercial Users must retain all records relevant to Software use, 
      revenue attribution, and Community Contributions for a minimum of five (5) years.

  d) Compliance Enforcement

      documentation constitutes a violation of this License and triggers Section 11 
      (Termination).

    •	For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be interpreted

      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

      without affecting the enforceability or validity of the remaining terms and 
      conditions.

  c) No Waiver
    •	No term or condition of this License will be waived, and no failure to comply 
      will be deemed consented to, unless expressly agreed to in writing by the Licensor.
