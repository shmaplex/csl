    "# Step 2: Why we use Difference‑in‑Differences (DID)  \n",
    "DID is a statistical method that lets us compare **before vs after** for “treated” packages (those that experience a major event), **while controlling for background trends** (like seasonality or overall npm growth).  \n",
    "- The `treated_post` variable (1 if package is “treated” and the time is after the event) helps isolate the **effect of the event**.  \n",
    "- By controlling for package-specific effects (`C(project)`) and month effects (`C(month)`), we reduce confounding from other factors.\n"
