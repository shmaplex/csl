    "## Parameter Sweep Analysis: CSL License Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we systematically explore **how key parameters of the CSL license affect open-source ecosystem outcomes**. Specifically, we vary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contributor Share Percentage (`contributor_share_pct`)**  \n",
    "   - The fraction of revenue from organizations that is directed back to a shared contributor fund.  \n",
    "   - Higher values mean corporations contribute more back to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Barrier to Entry (`barrier_to_entry`)**  \n",
    "   - A restriction that reduces the probability that large organizations can adopt the software.  \n",
    "   - Simulates the effect of CSL’s “corporate control” mechanisms or stricter compliance requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fork Penalty (`fork_penalty`)**  \n",
    "   - Adjusted automatically based on barrier level, representing the difficulty or cost for large organizations to fork and bypass contributions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Sweep Does\n",
    "\n",
    "We run simulations for **all combinations** of `contributor_share_pct` and `barrier_to_entry`. For each scenario, we track:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Final Contributor Fund**  \n",
    "  Total funds accumulated by the community after the simulation period.  \n",
    "- **Mean Active Developers**  \n",
    "  Average number of active developers contributing over time.  \n",
    "- **Final Adoption**  \n",
    "  Total adoption by all agents (Individuals, Small Orgs, Large Orgs) at the end of the simulation.  \n",
    "- **Final Market Concentration**  \n",
    "  Measures how concentrated revenue is among adopters (a proxy for monopolization risk).  \n",
    "\n",
    "By sweeping through the parameter space, we can **see which combinations best support a sustainable open-source ecosystem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading the Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "The heatmap shows the **final contributor fund** for each combination of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Y-axis (`Contributor Share %`)**: How much corporations contribute to the community.  \n",
    "- **X-axis (`Barrier to Entry`)**: How much adoption by large corporations is restricted.  \n",
    "- **Color intensity**: Higher values indicate **larger funds accumulated**, signaling stronger community support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition for Engineers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-right corner** (high share, high barrier): Large contributions but slow adoption; fund may grow rapidly, but fewer organizations can adopt.  \n",
    "- **Bottom-left corner** (low share, low barrier): Quick adoption but weak community support; contributor fund remains low.  \n",
    "- **Balanced middle areas**: Offer a compromise between adoption and community sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This sweep allows us to **quantify trade-offs** and make informed decisions about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How aggressively to require corporate contributions.  \n",
    "- How strict license barriers should be to maximize fund growth **without excessively limiting adoption**.  \n",
    "- How license parameters influence developer engagement and ecosystem health.\n"
