The Common Sense License (CSL) is a **source-available, ethical, and commons-oriented license** designed to:

- Keep software free for individuals, nonprofits, and cooperatives.
- Protect against extractive or exploitative corporate use.
- Encourage contributions back to a Commons Fund supporting open software projects.

## Key Features

1. **Ethical Use Restrictions:** Cannot be used for oppressive, surveillance, military, or extractive purposes.
2. **Reciprocity:** Large users must contribute ≥5% of net revenue or labor to the Commons Fund.
3. **Community Governance:** License changes and fund oversight are democratically managed.

## How to Use CSL

- Individuals and small organizations: automatically have rights under CSL v1.0.
